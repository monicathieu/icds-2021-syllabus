## Course description

This course aims to equip psychology majors with core competency with conducting behavioral science using programming tools, from building a functioning computer-based psychological task to analyzing and presenting data. Academic psychologists increasingly use such tools to support their research, and expect trainees to begin programs with prerequisite programming experience. Industry data scientists frequently work with human behavioral data, and training in behavioral science is key to rigorous, ethical applied science. This course thus aims to dramatize the importance of the relationship between programming skills and "pure" science for psychology undergraduates, and inspire excitement about the uses and joys of programming for psychologists.

## Learning objectives

### Programming literacy

By the end of this course, students will be able to…

- Diagram the parts and functions of a piece of pre-written R code
- Generate code to manipulate a dataset or produce a data visualization
- Identify and debug commonplace R errors

### Scientific concepts 

By the end of this course, students will be able to…

- Describe how scientific computing improves the quality of psychological science
- Critique the informativeness of a data visualization
- Assess what research questions a dataset can and cannot answer

## Prerequisites

A semester isn't a very long time, and we have a lot to learn! In order for us to focus on implementing psychological science concepts through programming in this class, I must be able to assume a certain amount of prior experience with those concepts so we can build on them in this class.

Therefore, to enroll in this class, you _must_ have taken:

- Introductory psychology
- Introductory statistics
